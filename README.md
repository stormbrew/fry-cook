# Fry Cook

*Not quite a chef yet, the fry cook knows only one menu.* 

Fry Cook is a chef server that is designed to be used with a
git repository (or working directory) that is to be treated as
a definitive source of truth. It is based on chef zero with
the Chef local filesystem data source, but has some modifications
on top of that.
